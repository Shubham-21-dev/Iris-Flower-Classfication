cross-validation.\n","\n","### Notes\n","- The accuracy score of the models depends on the observations in the testing set, which is determined by the seed of the pseudo-random number generator (random_state parameter).\n","- As a model's complexity increases, the training accuracy (accuracy you get when you train and test the model on the same data) increases.\n","- If a model is too
